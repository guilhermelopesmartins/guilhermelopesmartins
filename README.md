### Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm **Guilherme Lopes Martins**, a passionate Full-Stack Developer from **Brazil** 🌎. I love solving problems, designing innovative solutions, and turning ideas into impactful projects!

### 🚀 About Me

I have over two years of experience in software development, having worked at **BR GAAP**, where I developed and maintained systems using **C#**, **.NET**, **JavaScript**, **SQL Server**, **PostgreSQL**, and **SAPUI5**. During this time, I worked across both front-end and back-end layers, focusing on system improvements, performance optimization, and code refactoring to enhance scalability and maintainability.

Currently, I work as **IT Coordinator at USA Containers**, where I develop and maintain systems using **Python**, **FastAPI**, **Tortoise ORM**, **Vue.js**, and **JavaScript**. My responsibilities include integrating APIs, working with **AWS Lambda functions**, integrating our platform with third-party APIs, and handling daily operational and technical tasks. I am also responsible for designing and maintaining **automations in GoHighLevel (GHL)**, ensuring efficient workflows and process reliability across the company.

Previously, I worked as a developer at **Cumorah Academy**, where I built a Python-based API, configured and maintained Linux servers, and optimized internal processes—achieving a **94% reduction in analysis time**. I thrive in collaborative environments, enjoy mentoring developers, and actively contribute to agile teams following the **Scrum framework**.

**Fun Fact:** I started programming at 14 and haven’t stopped since!
